    <img src="../milanesas.jpeg" height="300">
    <p>This is the best dish ever, you can make it of different things like almost any type of meat like beef, chicken, pork, fish, etc or you can also have a veggie version of it like for example using aubergines. There's multiple ways or cooking them like in the oven, deep fried, on a pan or airfryer and they are always delicious. It is super versatile and very tasty. </p>
    <p>In this case we will make them of chicken breast and in the oven. Lets get started !</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>200g of chicken breast</li>
        <li>Bread crumbs</li>
        <li>One egg</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the chicken breast in slices</li>
        <li>In a bowl, put the egg with the salt and the pepper and mix it</li>
        <li>Add the chicken breast in the bowl with seasoned mixed egg</li>
        <li>On a flat surface, spread the bread crumbs and put one slice of the chicken covered in seasoned egg, cover it with more bread crumbs and with your hand press it against the chicken</li>
        <li>Continue to do the same with all the chicken making sure it ends up all covered by dry bread crumbs. That's almost it, you have finished your raw milanesas ! Lets bring them to the oven </li>
        <li>On a tray, put some olive oil, put the raw milanesas on top and put a little olvie oil on top</li>
        <li>Put the tray in a pre heated oven for aprox 20' at 250 degrees</li>
    </ol>
<p>Serve them on your plate with salad, fries, mashed potatoes or pasta as you prefer</p>
<p>Again I hope you enjoy this, one of my very top favourite dishes ever ! Known in other countries as schnitzel, with the diference that those are made of pork only and we make them of whatever we like the most !</p>
