# Odin-Recipes
First practice website of The Odin Project. Consisting on a simple website of recipes.
For this first Website project I'll out into practice a few things:
1- Creation of a HTML boilerplate.
2- Use of Headings, paragraphs, lists, photos, links to my own website.
3- Small HTML elements like Bold, Italic and comments in the code.
